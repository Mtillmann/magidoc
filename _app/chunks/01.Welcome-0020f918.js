Welcome to **Magidoc**! Magidoc a is a free open source project that can help you build static documentation website for GraphQL APIs or anything else (like this website). It aims to provide a fast variety of plugins and templates to provide as many options as possible with little efforts.

## Features

- \u{1F3C1} **Simple** - Build your first website in a few minutes.

- \u270F\uFE0F **Customizable** - Use pre-defined customizations without writing a single line of code, or start of from one of the available starters and make it your own.

- \u{1F4E6} **Fully Typed** - Every plugin and template ships with TypeScript definitions out of the box, for the best experience.

## Why Magidoc?

In the GraphQL world, there are many online web IDEs to play with GraphQL schemas. Namely, tools like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) are great for developers to play with your API. However, even though some documentation is available in those tools, it is not easily searchable, discoverability is difficult, and most of all, it lacks of a way to present concepts, workflows and examples.

Magidoc helps you achieve this with minimal effort. Either choose between one of the provided base templates with limited customization options, or generate a starter project from and customize it however you want using technologies you (or may not \u{1F608}) already know, like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (using [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)), and many others.
